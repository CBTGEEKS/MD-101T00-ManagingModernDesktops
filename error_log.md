### Managing Modern Desktops 

An issue has been identified regarding the _Creating device inventory reports_ lab in Module 4. In the last task, _Creating an Intune report using Power BI and Intune Data Warehouse_, on Step 21, instead of connecting to the Data Warehouse, the student will see an error that suggest credentials may not have sufficient rights.  This is not the intended behavior.

We are investigating the issue. At this time, it appears to potentially be a problem with the provided tenant. As a workaround, you may consider demonstrating the remaining steps to students using a different tenant and account that is licensed for Intune.  

We will continue to update and post notification here once the issue has been resolved. 

Thank you.
